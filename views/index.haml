            Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Bryan Bibat</span> and I'm a 
            <span class="highlight">freelance software engineer</span>
            based in Taguig City, Philippines. I have 9 years of experience in 
            developing software, mainly web applications.
          %p
            This is my mini-portfolio website. Here you can <a href="#portfolio" onclick="$.scrollTo('#portfolio', 200 ); return false;">browse</a> 
            what little work I could claim as my own (long story, just click the 
            link for a short explanation). You could also check what <a href="#services" onclick="$.scrollTo('#services', 200 ); return false;">services</a> 
            I offer.
          %p.last-para
            I guess you have some time on your hands since you're still reading this. In that case, you might want to head over to the <a href="#bio" onclick="$.scrollTo('#bio', 200 ); return false;">bio</a> section to know more about me. If you <em>really</em> have a lot of time on your hands, why not head over to <a href="http://blog.bryanbibat.net">my blog</a> and read about the geeky stuff I'm into.

            %li
              %strong Academic work e.g. thesis writing, solving machine problems
              \- I don't want to lower further the standards of local IT professionals. Instead of making me do your dirty work, I would prefer that you hire me as a tutor.

              %strong Non-Rails teaching gigs without training material 
              \- Good training material requires at least a month of preparation. Asking me to teach a class without those on hand would effectively reduce my trainer's fee by 80%. In short, if you don't have training material for the course I'm going to teach, prepare to pay me for the extra effort.

          %p
            While I may have worked with a bunch of platforms (and almost 
            all major commercial databases) in my previous work, I can't 
            put them here because of these three letters: 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement">NDA</a>.
          %p
            Given that all of my major projects for the <a href="http://www.gov.hk/en/">HK SARG</a>, 
            I chose not to include them in my portfolio rather than risk
            having Jackie Chan or Jet Li-type policemen barge in my house and 
            take me away somewhere.
          %p
            Anyway, here is my portfolio, a short list of stuff I made post-enterprise development:

            %p
              In my experience, one of the most annoying parts about teaching
              Ruby on Rails is installing the whole thing. Whether it's the
              training room having limited internet connection or the students
              blatantly ignoring the steps written in the training manual,
              expect a bunch of stuff to crop up at the start of the training
              to waste 2-3 hours of your allotted time.
            %p
              To remedy this problem, I've modified the official Ruby Installer
              for Windows to include all the necessary gems and dependencies to
              allow a trainee to start building Rails apps in less than 5 minutes.

          %p
            I'm a enterprise software engineer by trade but I got sick of the
            whole corporate world life and quit my job. Nowadays, I spend my time
            %strike playing online games
            doing research for my blog,
            building side projects, and taking occassional freelance jobs.
          %p
            Aside from development work, I also like to teach, especially given
            that local CS degree courses tend to be detached from the reality of
            software development.
            %a{:href => "http://blog.bryanbibat.net/tag/public-talk/"} Public speaking
            is also one of my unusual hobbies, as unlike most of my software
            development colleagues, I'm not afraid to talk about stuff that I'm
            passionate about.
          %p
            I am also currently the VP for Technology of 
            %a{:href => "http://devcon.ph"} Developers Connect Philippines
